# One-Time Passcode Generator Practice

## About:
I found a simple step-by-step tutorial [here](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/04/14/otp-verification-using-python/) that walks the user through creating a simple one-time passcode generator that will be sent to a user's email.

I haven't played with the built-in `smptlib` much, so this was some nice exposure to it.

## Versions:

**1.0.0**:  
- Take advantage of the `dotenv` package to read the environment variables created in the `.env` file I have.
- Make use of `sleep` from the native `time` library in Python
- Modify string outputs to be more user friendly/intuitive
